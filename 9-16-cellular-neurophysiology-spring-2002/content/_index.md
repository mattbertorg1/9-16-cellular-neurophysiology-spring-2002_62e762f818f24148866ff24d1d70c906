This course includes:

*   Surveying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal communication.
*   Coversion channels in excitable membrane, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity.
*   Correlation of the properties of ion channels and synaptic transmission with their physiological function such as learning and memory.
*   Discussion of the organizational principles for the formation of functional neural networks at synaptic and cellular levels.
